PKU-Reid dataset: This dataset contains 114 individuals including 1824 images captured from two disjoint camera views. For each person, eight images are captured from eight different orientations under one camera view and are normalized to 128x48 pixels. This dataset is also split into two parts randomly. One contains 57 individuals for training, and the other contains 57 individuals for testing. To the best of our knowledge, PKU-Reid dataset is the first one that captures person appearance from all eight orientations.

The image name is in the form "personId_cameraId_orientationId.png".
